// That made any descriptive name unaddressable. An agent registered as
// "MYNAH (SAGE Voice Bridge Agent)" — which is what CEREBRUM should show, so an
// operator granting domain access knows which row is which — could not be
// reached by "send this to mynah", which is what a human actually says.

// (toolFindAgent only falls back when localExact is empty), and every match is
// returned with its agent_id for the model to choose from rather than resolved
// silently to one.
